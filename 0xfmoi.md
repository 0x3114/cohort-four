# Ella's notes

Detailed updates are available here as a running list / live content her - https://hackmd.io/@xfmoi/B1ep19FKh.
*Most of my notes are kept analog on printed paper for more serious readings.*

## Week 1 Summary - in-flight / planned work
- Go through as much of the reading list as possible. 7 articles is the minimum bound.
- Jot down thoughts / observations on current vulnerabilities and new research on attack vectors.
- Find connections, patterns, and other angles / fundamentals to note.
- Make a list of whom to speak to not only as a mentor but generally industry-wide.
- Triage that my reading list is pretty comprehensive, my thoughts / understanding are in the right direction, and that I'm completely up-to-date with industry going-ons.

## Week 0 Summary - completed
- Strongly considering researching Ethereum fork-choice implementation - pre-work, digging, thinking. It might be interesting to explore attack vectors especially in light recent attacks on the Ethereum consensus.
- Spent time reflecting on the fundamentals of Etheruem consensus i.e. overlap with current BFT studies / work,
- Created a reading list pertinent to beginning research on fork-choice and single-slot finality on Ethereum / blockchain at large.
