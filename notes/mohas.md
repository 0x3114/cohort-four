# Mohas's Notes

## Introduction
Hi i'm Mohas :wave: , welcome to my notes !
Here i'll be sharing everything that i find usefull to my research like my progression, ressources, links , tips...

During the program i'll update my notes , so if you are interrested in my research try to check my notes .

## Research topic

My research topic is :

**Building a fuzzer or improve existing fuzzer for the ethereum protocol.**

I am interested in web3 security and ethereum so I chose to participate in this program with a project related to ethereum security :smiley:
I think the idea submited by mentor Frederik is a great idea , i'm very interested about it .

## Development Updates

## Recommandations / informations / tips

<details>
<summary>Which programming language to choose ?</summary>
<br>
Based on my research and some fuzzing experts Go and Rust are the best choices to make a fuzzer.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Should I create a fuzzer or contribute to an existing fuzzer</summary>
<br>
It depends on your preference, but according to a feedback contributing to an already existing project seems more doable if you do not have prior skills in fuzzing.
