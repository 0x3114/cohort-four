# Weekly update -Week2

Greetings everyone! Reflecting on my second week, it was a whirlwind of excitement and hard work. I had the privilege of participating in the Ethglobal hackathon, and I am thrilled to announce that I emerged as the winner! 🚀 🏆 🎉 My project, Xtreamly, made ingenious use of RPC nodes and Lua Libraries to enable Ethereum accounts to be programmable with scripting languages like LUA. You can learn more about my winning project here: [Xtreamly on Ethglobal Showcase](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/xtreamly-bqyjk). It's a moment of immense pride for me to secure the number 1 position for the Metamask Bounti.

While spending time in Paris during the week, I had the pleasure of engaging in enlightening discussions with Guillaume. Moreover, I had the opportunity to connect with my fellow participants and continued my dedicated efforts on the development of my Stateless Light client initiative. As part of this journey, I took the time to enhance my understanding of the Stateless Light client and discovered an exceptionally insightful article authored by Guillaume. You can explore this article here: [Verkle Tries Overview](https://efdn.notion.site/efdn/Verkle-Tries-Overview-fc7a2ada8fc1474c9358d402c0367e8a), which happens to be directly relevant to my ongoing work.

This discovery prompted me to embark on a deep dive into research, resulting in the consolidation of my thoughts and ideas. I've documented my findings in a comprehensive post that you can access here: [Enhancing Stateless Witness Generation for Efficient Verification in Ethereum](https://ethresear.ch/t/enhancing-stateless-witness-generation-for-efficient-verification-in-ethereum/16194?u=sogolmalek). In the week ahead, I am excited to continue validating and refining these concepts. With any luck, I hope to make significant strides in the development of various components.

Thank you all for your support and encouragement. Let's keep pushing the boundaries together! 🌟
