# Weekly update -Week3

Greetings everyone,

I'm thrilled to share the progress I've made this week. I've been dedicated to finalizing my proposal's architecture, a crucial step in bringing my vision to life. Through meticulous efforts, I've defined the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), shaping a clear direction for my project.

What truly invigorated me were the insightful discussions I had with some incredible mentors. Their guidance has been invaluable in refining my ideas and setting a solid course forward. Additionally, I had the privilege of engaging with experts in the realm of zero-knowledge proofs (zk), which provided me with a deeper understanding of how I can leverage existing implementations to achieve my MVP goals.

Anticipating the days ahead, I'm excited to announce my upcoming technical meetings, especially with the remarkable individuals at Reth. These sessions are crucial as they will allow me to pose important questions and gain the necessary insights to further prepare for the challenges of the coming week.

Continuing my commitment to thorough investigation and consultation, I'm pleased to share that I've made significant strides in the development of components for my inaugural issue: [Link to my GitHub issue](https://github.com/sogolmalek/EIP-x/issues/1). I've also taken the initiative to provide a comprehensive implementation report as a comment, enriching the collaborative spirit of the community effort.

Thank you all for your unwavering support and engagement. As I march forward, your encouragement fuels my determination to achieve greatness. Let's forge ahead and continue transforming ideas into reality! ðŸš€
