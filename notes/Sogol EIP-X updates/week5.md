# Weekly update -Week5

Greetings everyone,

I'm excited to provide you with some noteworthy updates from this week's endeavors. I've made substantial progress in implementing various components of the state provider entity, which you can explore in detail here: [EIP-x Client-Rust Repository](https://github.com/sogolmalek/EIP-x/tree/main/Client-Rust). To enhance clarity, I've included comments alongside the code and introduced new issues that outline what's been accomplished and the tasks that lie ahead. You can find these issues comprehensively documented here: [EIP-x GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sogolmalek/EIP-x/issues).

Building upon the invaluable feedback I received for the second part of my proposal, I've dedicated time to expanding my work. To foster collaboration and refinement, I'm in the process of arranging discussions with mentors. Their insights, approvals, and evolution suggestions are pivotal in shaping the trajectory of my project.

Fresh off the press, I've just published a detailed post that you can access here: [Towards a Stateless Account Abstraction: Expanding My Proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/towards-a-stateless-account-abstraction-expanding-my-proposal-for-efficient-witness-verification-and-state-provider-entities/16299?u=sogolmalek). This post delves into the ongoing evolution of my proposal and provides insights into its direction.

In the coming week, my focus is directed toward a session with experts in client architecture, particularly those skilled in consensus and peer-to-peer networking. Your expertise in these areas would be immensely valuable as I navigate the intricacies of these essential components.

I extend my heartfelt appreciation to all for your engagement, support, and feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and I encourage ongoing collaboration. If there's an intersection of interests and the potential for synergistic efforts, I'm eager to connect and explore possibilities. Let's continue on this exciting journey together! ðŸŒŸ
