# Weekly update -Week1

I'm excited to present my Week 1 update! During this time, I've been dedicated to crafting the Stateless AA architecture/Flow. A particularly enlightening moment occurred during a productive conversation with S1na. Together, we devised a groundbreaking conceptâ€”an introduction of a novel entity named the "trustless State provider." This innovation empowers transactions to seamlessly participate in the alt-mempool without the necessity of retaining the entire state.

For a quick overview of the key points, I invite you to peruse my detailed post at: https://ethresear.ch/t/proposing-new-entity-for-stateless-account-abstraction-trustless-state-provider-allowing-txs-to-enter-alt-mempool-without-holding-the-whole-state/16128). 

Furthermore, I've taken the initiative to outline the idea for this entity by creating the first issue on Github. You can explore this in-depth concept at: https://github.com/sogolmalek/EIP-x/issues/1. 

Moving forward, I plan to delve even deeper into the subject, focusing on its feasibility. I welcome the opportunity to engage with experts in the field of ZK who are intrigued by this concept. Collaborative discussions and insights will be invaluable as we collectively develop and refine this remarkable entity. I am confident that the trustless State provider has the potential to unlock a myriad of use cases within the Ethereum statelessness framework. Let's make it happen! ðŸš€
