I have some design notes on implementing redb in the slasher backend [here](https://hackmd.io/Nb-Y4cq2SkOTlPu5RO8kSw)

I also joined Lightclients tg group regarding updates/improvements to the execution layer json-rpc. Im dipping my toes into this project to see if theres any fit for me there. I am still going to contribute to lighthouse regardless of the direction I chose here.

Can find more details about this specific issue in the lighthouse github repo: [Add more slasher backends (redb, sqlite, postgres)](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/issues/4424)
