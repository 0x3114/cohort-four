# A Research Note from Enc(Mason)

## Intro
Hello all :wave:
I am Mason. My pleasure to be a part of the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship. 
My expertise and interests are in area of AI and Cryptography to make Web3 a more secure and privacy-preserving place.


## Why We Start from Stealth Address
In [Vitalik's recent "3 transitions" post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/06/09/three_transitions.html), he highlighted "As Ethereum transitions from a young experimental technology into a mature tech stack that is capable of actually bringing an open, global and permissionless experience to average users...The privacy transition - making sure privacy-preserving funds transfers are available, and making sure all of the other gadgets that are being developed (social recovery, identity, reputation) are privacy-preserving"

He further illustrated the idea of **Stealth Address** with a [more detailed post](https://https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/01/20/stealth.html) and [ERC-5564](https://https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5564) associated with it. However, this is not the first time that **Stealth Address** was proposed. Let's start from a literature review.
