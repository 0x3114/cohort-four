# Behkod's notes

## Planned Projects (OpenSource):

Based on the intersection of Ethereum ecosystem's desirable projects [[1](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/account-abstraction-grants#ideas),[2](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/project-ideas.md#by-yoav-weiss)] & my interests/capabilities; And of course according to the duration of the program, I've came up with the following projects to develop as time goes on. Under-estimations are & have always been an issue, specially when it comes to R&D, but I hope I can make impactful contributions during this initiative.

- [4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) block explorer.
- An alternative to [userop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/userop) Rust-based crate.
- Contributions to [aa-bundler](https://github.com/Vid201/aa-bundler):
  - [P2P Mempool of User Operations](https://github.com/Vid201/aa-bundler/issues/13)
  - [Integration into Reth](https://github.com/Vid201/aa-bundler/issues/15), specially with recent [0.1.0(Alpha)] release, regarding [Eth-Infinitism's p2p interface](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/bundler-spec/blob/main/p2p-specs/p2p-interface.md)

## Further Explorations:

- I'm also interested in exploring other approaches to AA, for example [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0nFyq9DDPw) & hopefully get ready enough to participate in upcoming developments in in-protocol account abstraction. But it will definitely come after getting things done for the current approach which it seems is here to stay for a forseeable future.

## Prior work, resources, reading

Since lots of articles out there are already availabe under tips of everyone's fingers, I'm going to list only the core/reference links below [obviously not covering all of my readings]. Even though, I'm planning to release a much friendlier version of thorough reading with developers-coming-from-EOA-mindset in mind as we go on (to address questions like [this](https://t.me/c/1847399756/487) which was very well addressed [here](https://t.me/c/1847399756/525) by Dror Tirosh)
