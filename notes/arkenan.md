# Tomás Arjovsky's Notes

## About me

Hi! My name is Tomás. I'm a software engineer from Argentina. I studied Computer Engineering at FIUBA (Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Buenos Aires), specialized in distributed systems. I've been interested in ethereum both from the technical side and for its social and echonomic value for some years now, and I've been active in creating web3 apps since. After going down the EIP rabbithole in my last project, building a wallet microservice, I'm more than excited to be taking part of the actual protocol ecosystem thanks to the EPF.

## Our project: the elixir consensus node

I'm joined by Martin Paulucci, Tomás Grüner and Paul-Henry Kajfasz in building a new consensus node in elixir. Elixir is an amazing functional language oriented to high-concurrency, based on Erlang, which was built for backbone-router firmware, handling millions of connections at a time. Due to it's concurrency model, preemptive scheduler and binary-matching built-in capabilities, using it for the consensus node was our go-to solution.
