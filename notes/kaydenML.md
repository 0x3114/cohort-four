# kaydenML's notes

## Introduction

Hi my name is Kayden Moroz Liebl and i am very excited to participate in this years cohort working hard to improve myself and my programming skills and learn even though im a permissionless participant.

 

## Planned Projects

- Glados

Iâ€™m interested on working hard on Glados because I believe that it suits my skill set the best and is a great place to improve myself and learn and am planing on working hard creating interesting ways to visualize important data through different graphs on the page and trying to make everything look nicer and cleaner as well as the main page of glados. I am really interested in working hard and learning many new things as well as making many useful contributions towards glados during this year's cohort and excited to be able to contribute in every way that I can either that be by large or small implementations.

## Working on Next 


- Finishing my Project Proposal after recieving feedback from JoshD


- Once the Implementation of DHT Census Pr is merged in this PR https://github.com/ethereum/glados/pull/117 I can continue to work on my piechart PR https://github.com/ethereum/glados/pull/136.


- reseach more into Kademlia and DiscV5


- Continue to look into writing tests in rust so I can become really good because it's a very important skill to have while contributing to the portal network.


- dynamically load each dashboard component


- unify the content and network dashboards into a single front-page view


- display where in the world the clients are located 


- display recently seen nodes 


- graph log2(node_id()) will be a range of 1 to 256


- continue aesthetic refinements where needed


- Look into more intresting data that I can display on the page through different graphs and looking for way's that I can improve glados in its entirety trying to make Glados look nicer and continue to add onto my list of contributions. 


- Continue to do more research into the Portal Network as well as Glados to try gain a even better understanding of them and a better understanding of everything works and what they do.


- Look into more ethereum resources to increase my knowledge of ethereum over all.
