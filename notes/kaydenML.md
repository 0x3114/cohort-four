# kaydenML's notes

## Introduction

Hi my name is Kayden Moroz Liebl and i am very excited to participate in this years cohort working hard to improve myself and my programming skills and learn even though im a permissionless participant.

 

## Planned Projects

- Glados

Iâ€™m interested on working hard on Glados because I believe that it suits my skill set the best and is a great place to improve myself and learn and am planing on working hard creating interesting ways to visualize important data through different graphs on the page and trying to make everything look nicer and cleaner as well as the main page of glados. In this pull request I created a pie chart to display how many nodes are on the network and which clients they are so trin, fluffy, ultralight and unknown there's still changes I am working on before this can be merged. I am really interested in working hard and learning many new things during this year's cohort and excited to be able to add interesting and important data to display through different graphs and interesting way's to display information.

## Working on Next 

- dynamically load each dashboard component

- display where in the world the clients are located 


- display recently seen nodes 


- display log2(node_id()) will be a range of 1 to 256


- continue aesthetic refinements where needed


- Continuing to Look into more intresting data that I can display on the page through different graphs and looking for way's that I can improve glados in its entirety trying to make Glados look nicer. 


- Continue to do more research into the Portal Network as well as Glados to try gain a even better understanding of them and a better understanding of everything works and what they do.


- Look into more ethereum resources to increase my knowledge of ethereum over all.
