# kaydenML's notes

## Introduction

Hi my name is Kayden Moroz Liebl and i am very excited to participate in this years cohort working hard to improve myself and my programming and problem-solving skills and learn even though im a permissionless participant.

 

## Planned Projects

Glados

- Project Proposal
  - https://github.com/KaydenML/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/Glados-PortalNetwork.md

Iâ€™m interested on working hard on Glados because I believe that it suits my skill set the best and is a great place to improve myself and learn and am planing on working hard creating interesting ways to visualize important data through different graphs on the page and trying to make everything look nicer and cleaner as well as the main page of glados. I am really interested in working hard and learning many new things as well as making many useful contributions towards glados during this year's cohort and excited to be able to contribute in every way that I can either that be by large or small implementations.

## Working on Next 

- I'm going to continue to help implement the DHT Census as much as I can considering it's giving my great learning oppertunitiy and the current graph I'm working on requires it to be Implemented and other graphs I'm wanting to implement


- Implementing Segmental Control features to seperate the Content Dashboard page into different sections and improve runtime complexity


- Implementing breadcrumb links to improve navigation


- Implementing Top Navigation to also imrpove the navigation of glados


- Once the Implementation of the DHT Census Pr is merged https://github.com/ethereum/glados/pull/117. I can continue to work on my piechart PR https://github.com/ethereum/glados/pull/136 and begin working on some of the other graphs I want to implement that require this like
    - the average data radius of nodes on the network
    - estimated total storage within a given network


- Do more research into Kademlia and DiscV5


- continue aesthetic refinements where needed


- Improve my understanding of Glados and the Portal Network even more


- Look into more ethereum resources to increase my knowledge of ethereum over all.

**Graph Ideas**
- the average data radius of nodes on the network


- estimated total storage within a given network


- A map graph that has dots on it that displays where in the world the clients are located 


- display recently seen nodes 


- graph log2(node_id()) will be a range of 1 to 256
