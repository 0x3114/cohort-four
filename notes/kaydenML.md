# kaydenML's notes

## Introduction

Hi my name is Kayden Moroz Liebl and i am very excited to participate in this years cohort working hard to improve myself and my programming and problem-solving skills and learn even though im a permissionless participant.

 

## Planned Projects

Glados

- Project Proposal
  - https://github.com/KaydenML/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/Glados-PortalNetwork.md

Iâ€™m interested on working hard on Glados because I believe that it suits my skill set the best and is a great place to improve myself and learn and am planing on working hard creating interesting ways to visualize important data through different graphs on the page and trying to make everything look nicer and cleaner as well as the main page of glados. I am really interested in working hard and learning many new things as well as making many useful contributions towards glados during this year's cohort and excited to be able to contribute in every way that I can either that be by large or small implementations.

### Quick Summary But I Highly Recommend Reading My Update On HackMD As Well

- Spent a ton of learning/experimenting and working on my query for the graph I'm working on


- Spent time researching on how the radius is handled in Trin.


- Fixed some issues regarding a few of my PR's after they were reviewed by Piper and a few my Mikem


- Decided on a better graph for the data I'm displaying https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/density_basic.html


- My Pie Chart graph was merged and went live on the Glados site. glados.ethportal.net


- Completed my sql query that I had been working on for a few days


- Created a PR that displays the audit stats on the home page of Glados which was merged and went live on Glados.
	- glados.ethportal.net
	- https://github.com/ethereum/glados/pull/165


- Spent some time converting my sql query to sea-query to be able to display it to the page and looping over some code I got from Trin


- Hopefully within the next few days I will have completed this graph and began working on my third graph and other things I plan to work on

### Working on Next

- Try to hopefully finish up my data Radius Graph within the next few day's or so, then begin working on my third graph


- After Piper reviewed my segmental control PR he felt it would be better to just implement it in bootstrap instead of me using my javascript because it's not trivial to maintain or test over the longevity of a project. Here's the bootstrap of how I would go about approaching this sort of thing.
	- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/utilities/visibility/


- Navigation Improvements and implementations like.
    - Nav Bar/ Top Navigation Feature
    - Breadcrumb Links


- Continue UI improvements where needed, we might be going to show Glados at Dev Connect so we want Glados looking as clean as possible for when the time arrives.


- Look into more ethereum/portal/network resources to increase my knowledge of ethereum, portal network and Glados over all.


- Writing Tests for bugs that I may find or may come up along the way.
