# kaydenML's notes

## Introduction

Hi my name is Kayden Moroz Liebl and i am very excited to participate in this years cohort working hard to improve myself and my programming skills and learn even though im a permissionless participant.

 

## Planned Projects

- Glados

Iâ€™m interested on working hard on Glados because I believe that it suits my skill set the best and is a great place to improve myself and learn and am planing on working hard creating interesting ways to visualize important data through different graphs on the page and trying to make everything look nicer and cleaner as well as the main page of glados. I am really interested in working hard and learning many new things as well as making many useful contributions towards glados during this year's cohort and excited to be able to contribute in every way that I can either that be by large or small implementations.

## Working on Next 


- Finish my Project Proposal for tuesday when I'm presenting.


- The Content Dashboard loads really slow so improving the speed that it loads. Here's an example of how i could achieve this by splitting the content page into several pages that each do fewer queries, 90% of the time we just want the latest data so this would be a good solution into solving this issue


- Implementing breadcrumb links to imrprove navigation


- Implementing Top Navigation to also imrpove the navigation of glados


- Once the Implementation of DHT Census Pr is merged in this PR https://github.com/ethereum/glados/pull/117 I can continue to work on my piechart PR https://github.com/ethereum/glados/pull/136.


- reseach more into Kademlia and DiscV5


- Continue to look into writing tests in rust to become very skilled at writing test's


- dynamically load each dashboard component


- unify the content and network dashboards into a single front-page view


- continue aesthetic refinements where needed


- Improve my understanding of Glados and the Portal Network even more


- Look into more ethereum resources to increase my knowledge of ethereum over all.

**Graph Ideas**
- the average data radius in the network 

- the estimated total storage within a given network

- A map graph that has dots on it that displays where in the world the clients are located 

- display recently seen nodes 

- graph log2(node_id()) will be a range of 1 to 256
