# kaydenML's notes

## Introduction

Hi my name is Kayden Moroz Liebl and i am very excited to participate in this years cohort working hard to improve myself and my programming skills and learn even though im a permissionless participant.

 

## Planned Projects

- Glados

Iâ€™m interested on working hard on Glados because I believe that it suits my skill set the best and is a great place to improve myself and learn and am planing on working hard creating interesting ways to visualize important data through different graphs on the page and trying to make everything look nicer and cleaner as well as the main page of glados. In this pull request I created a pie chart to display how many nodes are on the network and which clients they are so trin, fluffy, ultralight and unknown there's still changes I am working on before this can be merged. I am really interested in working hard and learning many new things during this year's cohort and excited to be able to add interesting and important data to display through different graphs and interesting way's to display information.
