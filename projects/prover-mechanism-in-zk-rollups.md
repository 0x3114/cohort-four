## **Towards Optimal Prover Mechanism in ZK-Rollups: A Comprehensive Analysis and Simulation**

## **Motivation**

The project aims to address the challenges related to selecting, managing, and incentivizing provers within the context of zk-rollup networks. Zk-rollups offer a promising solution to scalability issues in Ethereum by bundling multiple transactions off-chain and only submitting their cryptographic proofs on-chain. However, the efficiency and reliability of zk-rollup networks heavily rely on the proper functioning of the prover mechanism. Inadequate prover selection and incentives can lead to network congestion, security vulnerabilities, and decreased user trust.

## **Project description**

The proposed solution involves conducting a comprehensive analysis and simulation of the mechanisms governing the selection and management of provers within zk-rollup networks. The project will delve into the dynamic nature of how provers are chosen and motivated to participate, considering both technical and economic factors. By evaluating the current methods and incentives, the project aims to identify potential inefficiencies, vulnerabilities, and opportunities for improvement.

## **Specification**

The project will be implemented in 5 stages:

1. **Method Analysis:**

    - Conduct detailed analysis of existing prover selection methods and incentive mechanisms.
    - Define criteria for prover selection, encompassing decentralization, liveliness, censorship resistance, efficiency, and more.
3. **Economic Modeling:**
    - Develop an economic model to analyze the behavior of rational and irrational provers under various incentive structures, such as token burning and block reward sharing.
    - Consider variables such as gas prices, prover rewards, transaction fees and network congestion.
4.  **Simulation Development:**
    - Design and implement an agent-based simulation of the zk-rollup network in Python to validate the economic models.
    - Create a simulation framework that accurately reflects prover interactions, transactions, and network conditions.
    - Define scenarios with varying conditions to test the prover behavior and network performance under different incentive structures.
    - Perform sensitivity analysis by varying parameters to understand their impact on prover behavior, network performance, and security.
5. **Strategy Optimization:**
    - Propose optimization strategies for prover selection and incentives based on economic analysis and simulation results.
    - Consider potential bottlenecks and scalability issues, and propose strategies to ensure the long-term efficiency of the prover mechanism.
6. **Reporting and Presentation:**
    - Compile a comprehensive report that encompasses the entire project, including methodology, analysis, simulation, and proposed optimization strategies.
    - Prepare a clear and concise presentation summarizing the project's findings, insights, and recommendations.
    - Conduct a review of the report and presentation with peers and advisors to gather feedback and make refinements.

## **Roadmap**

- *Method Analysis* - September Week 1-2
- *Economic Modeling* - September Week 3-4

## **Possible challenges**

- **Realistic Modeling:** Creating accurate economic models and simulations that capture the complexity of network dynamics and participant behaviors can be challenging.
- **Incentive Alignment:** Designing incentives that encourage honest participation and discourage malicious behavior can also be challenging.
- **Data Availability:** Access to historical data and real-world network statistics may be limited, affecting the accuracy of the simulations and analysis.
   
## **Goal of the project**

The project's success will be measured by achieving the following outcomes:

- A comprehensive analysis of existing prover selection and incentive mechanisms in zk-rollups.
- A simulation that provides insights into the impact of different mechanisms on network performance and user experience.
- Identification of optimal prover selection and incentive strategies to enhance network performance, security, and scalability.
- Documentation of findings, methodologies, and recommendations in a research paper or technical report.

Upon completion, the project will contribute to the improvement of zk-rollup networks by ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the prover mechanism, ultimately facilitating broader Ethereum scalability and adoption.
